# Given the provided data, what are three conclusions we can draw about Kickstarter campaigns?

The three things that we can draw from the data provided and leveraging the pivot summaries requested, I can confidently say that:

- Theatre is a popular Category with the most projects and high success when looking at counts.
- Plays are the highest active subcategory, which makes sense since Theatre had a high penetration of project counts.
- December is not very popular when you aggregate project counts across years.

# What are some limitations of this dataset?

- We do not have disposition of why things failed, what made them successful. 
- We do not have a definition of columns like what makes up a staff pick or why things are in a spot light. 
- The data is older/outdated so did not even bother to do a trend discovery.

# What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

- growth or lack of growth over time. 
- penetration of the different countries. 
- which countries are failures or have a high penetration of failues. 
- what category got the most funding. 
- what countries got the most funding. 
- we can re-attribute some of the threatre projects to see what time of project if I had time were attractive to backers since sub-cat is pretty high level.
